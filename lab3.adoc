== Source to Image

One of the useful components of OpenShift is its source-to-image capability. S2I is a framework that makes it easy to turn your source code into runnable images. The main advantage of using S2I for building reproducible container images is the ease of use for developers. You'll see just how simple it can be in this lab.

=== Let's build a node.js web server using S2I
